The advantage of service discovery components is that clients do not need to know the exact position of services, what they have are just the registered name of services if they want to call or use them.
Usually, a microservice will register itself to the center of service discovery components when it was started successfully, including necessary parameters such as the unique name of service, IP address and the port bind.</description></item></channel></rss>
